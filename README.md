# DTCC Package Template

This is a template for creating Python packages as part of DTCC Platform.
The template supports the creation of Python packages that include
extensions implemented in C++ using [pybind](https://github.com/pybind).
The template is based on the template
[scikit-build-example](https://github.com/pybind/scikit_build_example)
provided by the pybind and uses
[scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core)
to create pip-installable Python packages that may leverage CMake for
building the C++ extensions.

This project is part the
[Digital Twin Platform (DTCC Platform)](https://gitlab.com/dtcc-platform)
developed at the
[Digital Twin Cities Centre](https://dtcc.chalmers.se/)
supported by Swedenâ€™s Innovation Agency Vinnova under Grant No. 2019-421 00041.
